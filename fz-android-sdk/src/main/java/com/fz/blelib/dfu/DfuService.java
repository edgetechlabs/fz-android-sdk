		 * However if the application has been closed during upload and user click the notification a NotificationActivity will be launched as a root activity.
		 * It will create and start the main activity and terminate itself.
		 * 
		 * This method may be used to restore the target activity in case the application was closed or is open. It may also be used to recreate an activity
